# Sentiment-analysis-British-airways
In this project i carryout a sentiment analysis of British airways customer reviews.

**Web scraping and analysis**

First we use a package called BeautifulSoup to collect and scrap the data from the web. Once we've collected our data and saved it into a local .csv file we'll start the analysis.

**Processing data**

Next i process the data by removing unwanted rows, stop words, removing trailing and leading white spaces, punctuations and numbers and converting to lower case.
Then i carry out Lemmatization, remove remaining special characters and remove duplicates.

**Exploratory Analysis**

I then carryout exploratory analysis by creating word clouds
